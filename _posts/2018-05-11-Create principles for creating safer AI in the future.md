## **2018 Google I/O Conference**
<br>
There is no denying that 2018 Google I/O has become the focus of much attention and popularity recently. Google's annual developer conference kicks off on May.8th in the dome of the Google Park.

If AI is the tool that everyone needs in the future, then perhaps no company knows how it is more suitable and how to use it than Google. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, came straight to the topic after the stage and talked about how AI technology diagnoses diseases, how Google Assistant can help us intelligently and how AI works in automatic driving technology. As we know, TPU is a special chip customized by Google for machine learning. It is designed specifically for Google's deep learning framework TensorFlow.

## **Will AI threaten the future of humanity?**
<br>

Obviously, these examples above are totally all aspects of AI's convenience to humans. However, has anyone ever thought about the potential threat that AI will bring to humanity in the future? At least it is a breeze to grab human's rice bowl, right? Professor Kaplan from Stanford made a statistic that 47% of the 720 jobs registered in the United States will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

Furthermore, there was a research demonstrates the percentage and probability of some kinds of careers could be automated and replaced by AI technology as following.

Do you remember that moment when AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol last year? Where we realize that AI is actually progressing a great faster than we expected during recent years. So why are people saying things like this, that AI might spell the end of the human race? Will robots rule all humans like Hollywood's plot in the future? These things sound like they are just a false alarm，but actually not!

The running robots show that Boston Dynamics is far from achieving their long-term goal—making robots like real humans and animals is not too far away.Whether it is production, scientific research or daily life, the world will experience a disruptive revolution with AI era's coming. Even Elon Musk alerted that our human beings need to be extremely careful with artificial intelligence, they are more dangerous than nuclear weapons!

## **Stuart proposed principles for creating safer AI**
<br>
However, AI pioneer Stuart Russell has proposed 3 principles for creating safer AI and demonstrated how we can harness the benifits of AI while also preventing the catastrophe of robotic takeover in TED talk, which has been the most significant prediction regarding the development of AI that I had ever watched.    
<br>


In general, Stuart is going to prove that AI is beneficial to humans, and the benefits alsolutely outweigh the disadvantages. Stuart's three safer principles are machines that are altruistic, who wants to achieve only our objectives, but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is that we really want. This kind of scenario is supposed to be intelligence of the robot get along with people from my opions.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
In fact, we have reasons for optimism. Since there is a massive amount of data, and robots are going to read everything the human race has ever written and thinking. Most of what we write about is human beings doing things or our own thoughts. That means robots can learn and understand from massive amount of data that human beings input in daily life， and robots will learn to become much smart than before. So there is absolutely no need for too much fear of AI threat in the future.   
<br>
<br>

From the first industrial revolution to the second industrial revolution, a large number of machines replaced the simple labor force. The unemployed workers hatered the machines. They smashed the machines, destroyed the factories. But in fact, everybody know that the development of the industrial revolution has benefited all humanity and promote social progress in long term.
<br>


As for human beings, the ideal state of the future is that although AI has made some people unemployed, it has helped people do most of the work. At the same time, since the wealth created by AI is sufficient for all people in the world, the vast majority of people are actually liberated and can do more things they want to do. In this way, human beings may have the motivation to learn more advanced skills, get start with more valuable things, and have more time to accompany our families.That is supposed to be our original intention and expectation.    
<br>
<br>

## **How human beings adapt to AI era's coming**
<br>

There is a joke like the machines are all learning, why do people not learn? Are you still anxious that your job will be replaced by AI? Looking for areas related to your expertise and what else will be involved in AI, then develop and improve the knowledge and skills needed for these areas of work. As we know, machine learning technology is the core technology of the new enthusiasm of AI. Whether it is robots, natural language processing, intelligent vision or drones are closely related to the intervention of machine learning technology. Machine learning occupies 60% of AI's investment. 
<br>

It demonstrates that each of us would be better to get started with machine learning area, also you will be able to keep an eye on the impact of AI on your industry and never stop learning and master new skills.

<font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
This is the best era and the worst as well. The era of AI has arrived already. What we can do is that to get start with AI technology learning and machine learing, to enrich our knowledge and establish a strong skill system, which can help human beings get more competitive and challenging in the future.
