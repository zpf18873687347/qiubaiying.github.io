There is no denying that 2018 Google I/O has become the focus of much attention and popularity recently. Google's annual developer conference kicks off on May.8th in the dome of the Google Park.

If AI is the tool that everyone needs in the future, then perhaps no company knows how it is more suitable and how to use it than Google. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, came straight to the topic after the stage and talked about how AI technology diagnoses diseases, how Google Assistant can help us intelligently and how AI works in automatic driving technology. As we know, TPU is a special chip customized by Google for machine learning. It is designed specifically for Google's deep learning framework TensorFlow.

Obviously, these examples above are totally all aspects of AI's convenience to humans. However, has anyone ever thought about the potential threat that AI will bring to humanity in the future? At least it is a breeze to grab human's rice bowl, right? Professor Kaplan from Stanford made a statistic that 47% of the 720 jobs registered in the United States will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

Do you remember that moment when AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol last year? Where we realize that AI is actually progressing a great faster than we expected during recent years. So why are people saying things like this, that AI might spell the end of the human race? Will robots rule all humans like Hollywood's plot in the future? These things sound like they are just a false alarm，but actually not!

AI pioneer Stuart Russell has proposed 3 principles for creating safer AI and demonstrated how we can harness the benifits of AI while also preventing the catastrophe of robotic takeover in TED talk, which has been the most significant prediction regarding the development of AI that I had ever watched.

In general, Stuart's 3 safer principles are machines that are altruistic, who wants to achieve only our objectives, but that are uncertain about what those objectives are, and will watch all of us to learn more about what it is that we really want. This kind of scenario is supposed to be intelligence of the robot get along with people from my opions.

In fact, we have reasons for optimism. Since there is a massive amount of data, and they are going to read everything the human race has ever written and thinking. Most of what we write about is human beings doing things or our own thoughts. That means robots can learn and understand from massive amount of data that human beings input in daily life， and robot will learn to become much smart than before. I totally agree with the view from Stuart, Our entire civilization, everything that we value, is based on our intelligence. And if we had access to a lot more intelligence, then there's really no limit to what the human race can do. So there is absolutely no need for too much fear of AI in the future.

As for human beings, repetitive and worthless labor will be replaced by AI machine which has a good news indeed. In this way, human beings can have the motivation to learn more advanced skills, get start with more valuable things, and have more time to accompany our families.That is supposed to be our original intention and expectation. 

This is the best era and the worst as well. The era of artificial intelligence has arrived already. What we can do is that to get start with AI technology learning and machine learing, to enrich our knowledge and establish a strong skill system, which can help human beings get more competitive and challenging in the future.
